This is a repository for Part of Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Models.
Markov Model - A stochastic process for which occurrence of current state(event)
depends on previous state(event).
In the POS Tagging problem, use of Markov models is done to overcome the shortcomings
of simple data driven models. In this method, the context of the sentence is inherited
by property of the markov model, which states that the probability of the next event only
depends on the current events.
The Hidden Markov Model is one of the most commonly
used algorithms in NLP, and is a foundation to many deep learning techniques. We will
build a Hidden Markov Model, and train it using a labeled corpus to predict Part of Speech given
a new sentence.
